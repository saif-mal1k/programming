- In scientific Applications where speed is very important.
- In Embedded Applications where resources are limited.
- In Video Games and Graphic Applications where environment is constrained.
- In complex Applications with millions of lines of code, such as compiler, browser, 
- Banking and trading systems where latency is important.
- in computer vision and image processing libraries such as OpenCV.
- C++ being effective and efficient in proper utilization of resources, it is widely prefered in competetive coding.
