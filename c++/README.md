***Answer:***
_C++ is a very powerful **systems programming language** , it is used in operating Systems, games and graphic engines, embedded systems, device drivers, development tools and much more. most notably it is used -_

- In scientific Applications where speed is very important.
- In Embedded Applications where resources are limited.
- In Video Games and Graphic Applications where environment is constrained.
- In complex Applications with millions of lines of code, such as compiler, browser, 
- In Banking and trading systems where latency is important.
- In computer vision and image processing libraries such as OpenCV.
- C++ being effective and efficient in proper utilization of resources, it is widely prefered in competetive coding.
	
> _although c++ is not a leading language, and the fact that most work requiring c++ is legacy systems, and in highly computational, complex systems with constrained environment. it is used by major companies such as BMW, Apple, Amazon, siemens..._
