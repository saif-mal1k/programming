    <b><em> Life cycle of python program </b></em>
  </summary>
  <p>
     
**note:**  all imported python modules/programes are compiled and respective byte code is stored in __py-cache__ folder in root path of project. then python projects are interpreted by PVM. 
all program code require to be converted to low level code “byte code” through compilation. same is true with python code it is compiled to byte code .pyc , although we don’t have to compile it ourselves.
